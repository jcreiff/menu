#Joe's Diner

A Railstaurant

###Menu Application

This Rails application offers an easily maintained online menu for restaurant owners.  
Bootstrap CSS stylings make the layout look clean and organized, and the easy-to-use
functions (namely, add a dish, edit a dish, or delete a dish) allow for instant
updates when inventory changes.
